**Which exchange?**
Please provide the name and URL of the exchange.

**XChange and x-change-stream support**
If an exchange is supported by XChange and xchange-stream, adding Orko support is usually pretty easy. If XChange is missing support, then the developer will have to add XChange support first, which makes the job much harder. Please check https://github.com/knowm/XChange and https://github.com/bitrich-info/xchange-stream and let us know if that work is needed too.

**Bounty**
Generally developers only add support for the exchanges _they actually use_.  That means that if you're asking for support for an exchange, you are asking a developer to create a feature that they personally will never use.  As a result, it is a good idea to offer a bounty, paid in crypto.
